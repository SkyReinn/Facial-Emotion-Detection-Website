# Facial-Emotion-Detection-Website
A website that uses CNN and transfer learning to detect facial emotions.

We weren't able to get our website working on a hosting platform, but we did get it to work on ngrok.
Because a ngrok session only lasts 2 hours, please email us if you guys want to visit the website.
Our emails are: 24wangy@tesdk12.net, 25raor@tesdk12.net
If you guys just want to see what the website looks like, there is a demonstration video at the end of the PPT.

This was more of a learning experience than a real website, but we do plan on making it better in the future,
including making it into an AI video chatbot that detects emotions and responds accordingly.
We learned a lot about Machine Learning Pipelines, Convolutional Neural Networks, front-end development, and back-end development.
Hope you guys like it!
